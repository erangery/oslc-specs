        This specification defines the OSLC Link Discovery Management service, a RESTful web services interface for the
        discovering incoming links to a set of possibly versioned resources. To support these scenarios, this specification
        defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, as well as
        HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource formats.

    <section id="intro" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The OSLC link discovery service is a new OSLC specification, that comes to standardize already existing practices for incoming links discovery. The current OSLC core specification does not prescribe how bi-directionality of links is implemented. Nevertheless with the introduction of versioned OSLC providers, the simple technique of storing backlinks appears to be very problematic and highly unrecommended. This is documented in the non-normative OSLC linking profiles draft specification. The scalable approach that has been practiced by several implementors such as IBM ELM and MID Smartfacts, is to manage a centralized link discovery service that supports OSLC providers to discover incoming links. For example a requirements management (RM) application can display incoming links to specific requirement resources  stored in a QM application. To an end user the “incoming links” are essential to carry out various lifecycle activities, such as understanding coverage and/or impact of a set of requirements. The discovery service comes to standardize the already existing practical approaches for OSLC linking, which are proprietary and force implementors to deal with different proprietary approaches, which counters the goal of OSLC.
      </p>
      <p>
        Current OSLC based digital thread implementations require to support bi-directional navigation across OSLC links. With the introduction of resource versions in OSLC Configuration Management, bi directional navigation can no longer be based on “backlinking”. The alternative approach is to use peer to peer OSLC query, where a provider queries each its related providers for incoming links, or to use a centralized link discovery service. While the peer to peer query addresses the fundamental issues of backlinking, it does not scale well to deployments with more than a small number of related providers and is not designed to perform. The scalable approach is a discovery service that can provide the requested incoming links using a single inquiry. This service can be performance optimized. OSLC currently does not have a specification of how to utilize such a service. Existing solutions are based on proprietary APIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Solution Scope includes specification for an incoming link discovery service that specifies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to discover an incoming links service provider</li>
        <li>How to inquire incoming links to versioned resources for a provided set of (displayed) concept resource URIs and a given configuration context</li>
        <li>How to replicate links to link indizes, considering initial load</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additional requirements</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Incoming links service providers operate in configuration enabled contexts. Therefore, the incoming link inquiries shall specify configuration contexts for the links</li>
        <li>It is TBD whether the specification accounts for multiple link discovery service providers or provides guidance on how to deal with multiple providers</li>
        <li>The specification does not specify how link discovery services ingest data from the various lifecycle providers, in order to effectively support the inquiries. That said, a common way of ingesting and maintaining a link index to support the inquiries uses already standardized OSLC Tracked Resource Sets</li>
      </ul>

        This specification is a [[!OSLCCore3]] compliant specification, and as such most of its content are references

        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <dl class="spaced">
          <dt><dfn>Link</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            An assertion or RDF triple consisting of a (subject, predicate, object) that manifests an instance of a relationship between the referenced subject and object.
          </dd>

          <dt>LDM Client</dt>
          <dd>
            An implementation of an application that consumes services provided by LDM servers to discover the scope of available links, and incoming links to a particular set of target resources.
          </dd>

          <dt>LDM Server</dt>
          <dd>
            A server implementing the OSLC Link Discovery Management specification. OSLC LDM clients consume
            services provided by LDM Servers to discover incoming links. The use of the terms Client and Server are intended to distinguish typical
            consumers and providers of OSLC resources in a distributed environment based on REST. A particular
            application component could be a client for some OSLC domain services and a server for the same or another
            domain.

      <h2>Base Requirements</h2>

      <p>
        The following sub-sections define the mandatory and optional requirements for an OSLC Architecture Management
        (OSLC AM) server.
      </p>

      <section id="baseCompliance">
        <h2>Base Compliance</h2>
        <p class="conformance">
          This specification is based on [[!OSLCCore3]]. OSLC AM servers MUST be compliant with both the core
          specification, MUST follow all the mandatory requirements in the normative sections of this specification, and
          SHOULD follow all the guidelines and recommendations in both these specifications.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following table summarizes the requirements from OSLC Core Specification as well as some additional
          requirements specific for LDM Servers. Note that this specification further restricts some of the
          requirements from the OSLC Core Specification. See the previous sections in this specification or the OSLC
          Core Specification to get further details on each of these requirements.

          In addition to the namespace URIs and namespace prefixes <code>oslc</code>, <code>rdf</code>,
          <code>dcterms</code> and <code>foaf</code> defined in [[!OSLCCore3]], OSLC AM defines the namespace URI of
          <code>http://open-services.net/ns/am#</code> with a preferred namespace prefix of <code>oslc_am</code>.

        <p>
          In addition to the requirements for resource representations in [[!OSLCCore3]], this section outlines further
          refinements and restrictions.
        </p>

        <p>For HTTP GET/PUT/POST requests on all OSLC AM and OSLC Core defined resource types,</p>

        <ul>
          <li class="conformance">
            LDM Servers MUST support RDF/XML representations with media-type <code>application/rdf+xml</code>. AM Clients
            SHOULD be prepared to deal with any valid RDF/XML document.
          </li>
          <li class="conformance">
            LDM Servers MUST support XML representations with media-type <code>application/xml</code>. The XML
            representations MUST follow the guidelines outlined in the

            LDM Servers MAY support JSON representations with media-type <code>application/json</code>. The JSON

        <h2>Resource Operations</h2>

        <p class="conformance">
          For compatibility with OSLC 2.0, OSLC LDM Servers MAY accept the OSLC Core Version header (OSLC-Core-Version:
          2.0) in any HTTP request as specified in [[!OSLCCore3]], and return an OSLC AM 2.0 representation (including
          the OSLC-Core-Version: 2.0 header). If the OSLC Core Version header is absent on a request, or has some
          undefined value, the OSLC AM Server MUST return an AM 3.0 representation.
